    "*Regular expressions are a powerful and standardized way of searching, replacing, and parsing text with complex\n",

    "**Why Do We Use Regular Expressions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find yourself using a lot of different string functions with if statements to handle special cases, or if you're combining them with split and join and list comprehensions in weird unreadable ways, you may need to move up to regular expressions. Regular expression syntax is tight and unlike normal code but the result is more readable code that looks better than a hand−rolled solution that uses a long chain of string functions."
